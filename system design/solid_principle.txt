SOLID Principles:

S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 
            A class should have one and only one reason to change.
O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): 
            Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): 
            Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): 
            Classes should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 
            High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

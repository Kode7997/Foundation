Question1: rotating the array in O(1)
len = 4; 1,2,3,4
k = 10

10%4 = 2

1st = 4123
2nd = 3412


for i: 0->k%n:

temp = 4
for j in len(arrr):
    replace all elements from last index in an array
    array[len(l-j)] = array[l-j+1]

    if len(l-j) == 0:
        array[0] = temp





Question2: adding two number usin linked list. considering each linked list node will have single digit number

1->2->3
8->9->9

representation of numbers in linked becomes key factor here. if numbers are represented in reverse order then logic is straight forward else it bit tricky to solve the problem
LL1 = node, LL2=node2

method1:

traverse each linked list to the end


Question3:

# Medium to Hard Data Structures Questions (Practical)

## 1. Interval Tree for Range Queries
**Problem:** Implement an interval tree to efficiently handle range queries and updates for intervals. Use cases include calendar event conflict detection, computational geometry, and database range queries.

- Solution: See `solutions/interval_tree.cpp`

---

## 2. LRU Cache with O(1) Operations
**Problem:** Design and implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache that supports O(1) get and put operations. Use cases: memory management, web caching, database query caching.

- Solution: See `solutions/lru_cache.cpp`

---

## 3. Thread-safe Hash Map
**Problem:** Implement a hash map that supports concurrent access and updates from multiple threads. Use cases: multi-threaded servers, real-time analytics, distributed systems.

- Solution: See `solutions/thread_safe_hash_map.cpp`

---

## 4. Persistent Segment Tree
**Problem:** Implement a persistent segment tree to support efficient range queries and updates, while keeping previous versions accessible. Use cases: versioned databases, undo operations, time-travel queries.

- Solution: See `solutions/persistent_segment_tree.cpp`

---

## 5. Trie with Wildcard Search
**Problem:** Implement a Trie data structure that supports wildcard searches (e.g., '?', '*'). Use cases: autocomplete, spell checking, search engines.

- Solution: See `solutions/trie_with_wildcard.cpp`

---

## 6. Disjoint Set with Path Compression and Union by Rank
**Problem:** Implement a disjoint set (union-find) data structure with path compression and union by rank. Use cases: network connectivity, Kruskal's algorithm, social network analysis.

- Solution: See `solutions/disjoint_set.cpp`

---

## 7. Doubly Linked List for Real-time Event Queues
**Problem:** Implement a doubly linked list to manage real-time event queues with efficient insertions and deletions. Use cases: event-driven systems, task schedulers, undo-redo functionality.

- Solution: See `solutions/doubly_linked_list.cpp`

---

## 8. Min Heap for Dynamic Median Calculation
**Problem:** Use two heaps (min and max) to efficiently calculate the median of a dynamic stream of numbers. Use cases: real-time analytics, financial systems, telemetry.

- Solution: See `solutions/dynamic_median.cpp`

---

## 9. Graph with Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path
**Problem:** Implement a weighted graph and use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes. Use cases: navigation systems, network routing, logistics.

- Solution: See `solutions/dijkstra_graph.cpp`

---

## 10. B+ Tree for Database Indexing
**Problem:** Implement a B+ tree for efficient database indexing and range queries. Use cases: database engines, file systems, search engines.

- Solution: See `solutions/bplus_tree.cpp`
